This project was created by Richard Haddlesey

I used 'npx create-react-app todo' to set up the project after I installed and updated Node, NPM, Yarn etc on my windows machine

I have left in - but commented out - my console.logs so you can track my thinking and testing

I have stopped at trying to style the checkbox without having to add a dependency like bootstrap to add a styled button - I hope that is ok?

I would also have made delete, add and edit separate components if I had more time.
